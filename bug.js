This bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue is that the `renderItem` function is called repeatedly for the same item, causing performance issues and potentially incorrect rendering. This can happen if the `keyExtractor` function is not correctly implemented or if there are issues with data updates that cause unnecessary re-renders.
